# RSBuild RSC Playground

Experimental playground for React Server Components with RSBuild.

## Working

- `import with { env: "react-server" }` for layer separation
- `use client`
- `use server`
- inlined server actions
- CSS imports in client components

## Not Working

- Code splitting
- CSS imports in server components
